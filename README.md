RESOLVE (REusable SOftware Language with VErification) is a specification and programming language designed for verifying correctness of object oriented programs.

The RESOLVE language is designed from the ground up to facilitate *mathematical reasoning*. As such, the language provides syntactic slots for assertions such as pre-post conditions that are capable of abstractly describing a program's intended behavior. In writing these assertions, users are free to draw from from a variety of pre-existing and user-defined mathematical theories containing fundamental axioms, definitions, and results necessary/useful in establishing program correctness.

All phases of the verification process spanning verification condition (VC) generation to proving are performed in-house, while RESOLVE programs are translated to Java and run on the JVM.

## Project Goal
This project's goal is to implement a new proving architecture as detailed in the following diagram.

## Authors and major contributors

This iteration of the RESOLVE compiler is being developed as a student capstone project at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, advised by [Dr. Joseph Hollingsworth](mailto:hollings@rose-hulman.edu). This work is based on the [Clemson Univerity RESOLVE compiler](https://github.com/ClemsonRSRG/RESOLVE).
